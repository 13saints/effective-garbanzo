## Pokemons for memorizing phone numbers.

"The day I have to use a phone-book is the day I'll quit playing chess." Kasparov is said to have uttered something along these lines. There was a time when you had to memorize all the phone numbers you had because losing your phone-book could land you in trouble. Now, memorizing phone numbers doesn't even cross our mind. It's an art we are losing. 

Set 0 as Voltorb (#100). Numbers 1-9 are easy: Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur, Charmander, Charmaleon, Charizard, Squirtle, Wartortle, and Blastoise. Suppose a number you have to memorize has three 9s in it. You have to visualize Blastoise thrice. Also, in total, you have to visualize ten of the pokemons above. This gets demanding and boring.

To overcome these problems, I have set out to memorize the first hundred. Pokemons 10-26 are easy enough too: 10 Caterpie, 11 Metapod, 12 Butterfree, 13 Weedle, 14 Kakuna, 15 Beedrill, 16 Pidgey, 17 Pidgeotto, 18 Pidgeot, 19 Rattata, 20 Raticate, 21 Spearow, 22 Fearow, 23 Ekans, 24 Arbok, 25 Pikachu, 26 Raichu.

73 more to learn.
